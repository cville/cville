This is a shared "todo" list for the town of [Charlottesville] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlottesville,_Virginia). This is a citizens' initiative to foster greater collaboration on issues concerning our area. Have an idea? Then ...

2. [Search](https://github.com/cville/cville/search) and/or [browse the issues](https://github.com/cville/cville/issues) to see if anyone already suggested your idea.
3. Catch up on the conversation to date.
4. Pitch in! Do work! Get stuff done!
5. Report back by posting a comment on the issue.

No ideas off the top of your head? Then go see [what we're already working on](https://github.com/cville/cville/issues).

Let's get on the same page and communicate about what we're all working on, so that we can make progress towards common goals! :-)
